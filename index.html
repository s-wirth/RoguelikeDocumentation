            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
            This plan will probably change a bunch during implementation. The numbers are almost certainly off and will be balanced out as I go.

            <h3>Base</h3>
            <p>
              The game is a very traditional Roguelike. It consists of a levelsystem, through which the player, has to fight their way to the top level.
              Each level has 4-5 sublevels. I.e. you have to get through the "Sewer Level", which consists of 5 levels itself, connected whith doors, stairs, etc.
              <br/>
              You will choose a character at the beginning of the game, who you will level up through fighting and killing enemies and using items. For simplicity there will be only one
              character in the beginning.
              <br/>
              Similiar games are NetHack, PixelDungeon, etc.
              <br/>
              To begin with the game will include only one level, one hero type and the basic enemy types, to create a fully playable game with a proper code structure.
